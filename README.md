# BadoFem
This software has been written in order to draw and analyse the linear truss structures interactivly.
## Fem package 
This package solves the linear 2D and 3D truss elements based finie elements method. 
## GUI package 
This packge is a graphical user interface, which is more user friend in order to calculate the 2D liner truss structures.

### The capabilities 

- Creating the nodes and elements by clicking and dragging.
- Saving and loading the structures
- Editting and removing the nodes and elements

### Models
There are two models of 2D and 3D structures in order to test the software.
